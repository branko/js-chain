# Short term
- Implement validation in post (client.js).
- Implement dynamic IP tracking of peer (blockchain.js).
- Put addresses in local .json and iterate over them to send posts after mining a block
- Broadcast transactions
  - minimum transactions to begin mining
- Organize javascript files: place in /scripts
  - this will require rerouting of blockchain.json file
- Generate sk/pk using RSA


# Long term
- Make front end to interact with blockchain
- Migrate to Diglet instead of ngrok
